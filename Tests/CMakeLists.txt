Unit tests for foleys_gui_magic

The Catch2 library is used to build the unit test runner. Catch2 is fetched at
configure time using FetchContent.

The option FGM_TEST_INSTALL, when on, calls find_package(foleys_gui_magic) and 
builds the unit test runner against this installed package. This can be used to
test the installation process. Defaults to off.
